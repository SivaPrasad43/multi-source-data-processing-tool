# multi-source-data-processing-tool

Objective/ solution:

The solution we are building is a data pipeline automation tool that allows users to define, configure, and run data processing workflows with minimal effort. This tool takes input from various sources like Kafka, databases, files (CSV), HTTP APIs, and more, applies transformation logic, and outputs the processed data to various destinations like databases, APIs, or Kafka topics. The whole pipeline is configurable using YAML files or from User interface, making it easy to adapt to changing requirements without requiring changes in the underlying code.

Major use case

1. Seamless Data Ingestion and Transformation with Configurable Pipelines: The solution offers a fully configurable pipeline setup, allowing users to define data sources, transformation rules, and output destinations through simple YAML configuration files/ User Interfce. This flexibility ensures the solution can cater to diverse business needs with minimal coding effort.

2. Modular and Extensible Architecture: The tool's modular design allows easy expansion by adding new input sources or output destinations without altering the core system. It supports integration with a wide range of data systems, such as Kafka, HTTP APIs, databases, and file storage systems, making it a versatile solution for dynamic data environments.
